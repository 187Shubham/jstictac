Tic-Tac-Toe Game
I built this Tic-Tac-Toe game as a fun project to learn the basics of JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and array methods. The game allows two players to take turns and checks for win conditions dynamically. This project helped me improve my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving.
